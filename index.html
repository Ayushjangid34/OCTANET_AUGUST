    <img src="section-heading.png" alt=":(" id="section-heading-image">
    <p id="para">Student Management System (SMS) is a software designed to track and manage all the data created by the school/college such as a student's Name, College name, Section, batch, E-mail, Phone, DOB, Student Photo, Mark Sheets etc.It is able to collect school/college-wide data online so that it can be easily accessed by teachers, parents, students, and administrators. 
      <br>
      A Student Information System, or SIS, is a web-based platform that helps schools and colleges take data online for easier management and better clarity. That's at its most basic. <br>
      To be clear, it's an SIS we're talking about here, which can also break down into a Student Management System (SMS), Student Information Management System (SIMS), or Student Records System (SRS) - all created to help keep records digitally.

          <img src="section-heading.png" alt=":(" id="section-heading-image">
          <p id="para">The Student Information System is there to create a self-service solution for students to get their administrative tasks done in one place. Equally, it is can support faculty and staff by helping to simplify and integrate work processes.
              <br>
            Since the SIS can be used as a digital dropbox of sorts, it's ideal for parents who want to access information on their child, communicate with the school, and even make payments. 
            <br>
            The ability to standardize data formats between divisions means a more unified and clear data readout at a glance, ultimately saving time.
            <br>
            When it comes to student records, an SIS offers high efficiency as all data is automatically organized and stored for easy access whenever it is needed. 
            <br>
            Since the platform is cloud-based, is can be reconfigured as needed to make sure it grows with an institution. Most SIS offer open interfaces and integration with other campus applications and database systems, making for ease of use.

                  The vast amount of information generated by every student can systematically and efficiently be updated on the student data management software, thereby facilitating the administration to manage as well as organize all kinds of information, ready to be used as and when needed. The faculty can effortlessly issue updated report cards, manage student's transcripts and obtain any information on the go. A student's progress can also be tracked with the help of various analytic tools and dashboards available, which also have various types of filters for varying uses. Also a student's health records can be maintained in order to be informed about any allergies or illnesses they might suffer from, to keep a check on their well-being.
